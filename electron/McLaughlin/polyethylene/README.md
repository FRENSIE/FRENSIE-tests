## McLaughlin polystyrene experiment ##

# Experimental
100 keV electrons on polyethylene for a 1D dose profile.
The polyethylene consists of H (14%) and C (86%) and has a density of 0.94 g/cm2.

# Setup
Tally in 50 uniform subzones over 1.1 cm.

# Running the simulation if FRENSIE

# Running the simulation if MCNP6.2
