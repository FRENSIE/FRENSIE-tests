## Sanford experiment ##

# Experimental
0.75 MeV electrons are incident on a carbon convertor.
The convertor is a cylinder 0.48 cm thick, and 1 cm in radius.
Electrons are normally incident in the direction of the cylinder axis, centered,
and with a radius of 0.1 cm.
A CaF2 detector is down-stream from the electron source by 30.22 cm, sandwiched
by 0.22 cm thick aluminum equilibration layers on each side.
There is air between the convertor and detector, at scaled density for
Albuquerque.

# Setup
Tally in the CaF2 in 2.5 cm radial regions out to 60 cm.

# Running the simulation if FRENSIE

# Running the simulation if MCNP6.2
