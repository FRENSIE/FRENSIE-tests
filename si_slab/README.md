Silicon Slab Test Problem 
=====

## Description
The descriptions of a the electron silicon slab test problem

## Geometry
An infinite slab of silicon 4 microns thick in a vacuum. The slab is represented
in Root as a (5cm, 5cm, 0.0004cm) (x, y, z) box of Silicon at the origin (0, 0, 0).

## Source
The source is a mono-energetic (15keV) electron beam. The beam is
mono-directional of 0 diameter in the Z direction. The position of the beam is
slightly off the origin (-0.01cm) in the Z direction (0, 0, -0.01).
